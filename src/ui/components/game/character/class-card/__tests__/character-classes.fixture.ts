        'The Ardent weaves arcane power into complex chains of magic that can lay waste to an entire battlefield or strike down single targets with merciless efficiency. As mercurial and dangerous as the untameable magical forces she parleys with, the Ardent is driven by a burning obsession with power that makes her a fearsome ally, and an even more terrifying enemy.',
