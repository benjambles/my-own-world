# Characters
A character represents a member of an exploration team. They have a mixture of RPG and Skirmish stats that represent their ability to succeed in a variety of situations. Alongside this they have stats that boost their skills and abilities, or offer new actions.

## Roleplaying
The Roleplaying aspect of the game is generating an ongoing campaign in which your team evolves over time. This can be through gaining equipment and training using resources found in skirmishes, building relationships that grant additional types of training and equipment, and access to freelancers, or through taking part in story events between missions.

### Stats

#### Perception

#### Charisma

#### Insight

#### Relationships/Factions

## Skirmish

### Stats
Combat is a small tactical affair in which a small fireteam of well trained individuals takes on a mission that may involve other AI or player controlled factions, or complete an action within a set time period.

#### Toughness
Toughness represents how many wounds a character can take before being taken out of action. The more wounds they take over this threshold the less likely they are to survive post mission when rolling to see if they survive. Toughness can be restored with healing items, or by skilled medics/technicians. Injured characters have fewer action slots available per combat round.

Note: Damaged/Destroyed body parts are separate to toughness and must be healed through either specific skills or post battle in a campaign through a clinic (or equivalent e.g. medi-table in a hideout).

#### Strength
Strength represents their ability to to perform actions that require physical ability, such as moving something heavy, brawling, or carrying heavy objectives. Strength can be augmented by armour, exosuits and in rare cases drugs.

#### Willpower
Willpower represents a characters ability to deal with stressful situtations, and their likelihood to break under pressure. It can be recovered with drugs, or by taking certain actions (like meditation). Characters that are below certain willpower thresholds may not be able to take certain actions (like aiming).

#### Defense
Defense represents the ability to shrug off attacks whether that be from the characters natural damage resilience, or any armour they have. There is no differentiation between damage types in regards to blunt,slashing etc.

Note: Some weapons may be less (or ineffective) against characters depending on their traits (emp not affecting a non-augmented, or non-synthetic character). These resistances impact the damage dealt, not the likelyhood of the damage.

#### Actions
Actions are the number of skills (some of which may take multiple actions) a character can use in a given round.

### Actions
Actions are the way a character interacts with the world around them. Actions may be movement related, shooting, interacting with the environment, melee, using items, and many more. Certain equpiment will increase the actions you have available to you, such as throwing grendades or using stims. Being in different stances will change what actions are available to a character. For instance a character in stealth cannot sprint, and a character that is moving fast can not aim.

### Stances
Stances represent how a character is currently acting, and changes their movement speed, and the actions available to them. Stances can only be changed at the start of a round of combat.
  
### Equipment

#### Slots
Equpiment slots exist for multiple areas of the body. Each of those slots chooses a base item, and then if possible that item may be upgraded with additional functionality. e.g. A helmet may be upgraded with multispectrum goggles and a rebreather. Body parts may also be replaced with cybernetics either for general upgrade benefits, or due to injuries. Cybernetics can be damaged/destroyed. Â 

- Head:
- Torso:
- Left Arm:
- Right Arm:
- Left Leg
- Right Leg

A character can carry up to 4 hands worth of weapons. This may be two two handed, one two handed and up to two one handed, or up to four one handed weapons. This does not include additional weapons such as traps and throwables.

#### Types  

### Damage

#### Hit zones

There are 6 hit zones on a character, on an aimed attack you may pick which you are swinging at. If you did and score a crit that body part takes damage and causes changes to the characters available actions/weapons/stances etc. Any body part that takes 2 crits in a mission should check for destruction after the mission. Two crits to the head is considered death. A critical hit also causes Willpower damage
